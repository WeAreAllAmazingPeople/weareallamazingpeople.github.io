    <h2>Hello, is it me you're looking for?</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm a Karel, software coach @ Switchfully.
    I'm the junior member on the Switchfully team,
    but I got bitten by the java-training-bug 🐞 years ago.
    (<strong>Yes, that's a real thing!!</strong>)
    The last few years, before joining Switchfully,
    while working as scrum master (fancy word for project manager),
    I promoted the <a href='https://agilemanifesto.org/' target='_blank'>agile values</a>
    together with the software development teams I was collaboring with.</p>
    
    <h2>I want more</h2>
    Besides a strong interest in learning people to program,
    there are other (technical) topics <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyO1dRCNnTY' target='_blank'>"I want more"</a> off.

    <ul>
      <li>I want more QR codes</li>
      <li>I want more security and privacy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What Else Is There? 他には何があるの?</h2>
    <p>So? <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4rZE_J1beA' target='_blank'>What Else Is There?</a>
    
    I'd like to harvest my own vegetables at <a href='https://www.boerencompagnie.be/' target='_blank'>a farm in Leuven</a>
    and starting in August I'll try to study some Japanese on Duolingo.
    (<em>At this moment, I have absolutely NO idea what the strange characters in the title actually mean ...</em>)</p>
    
    <h2>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</h2>
    <p>That's it for today!
    The next few months, Switchfully will be your Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy of programming
    and I am genuinely honoured to be part of your journey to become a passionate software developer.
    
    Talk to you soon, in the Switchfully chat!</p>
