Switchfully HTML Hello üëãüèΩ

## Hello, is it me you're looking for?

Hi, I'm a Karel, software coach @ Switchfully. I'm the junior member on the Switchfully team, but I got bitten by the java-training-bug üêû years ago. (**Yes, that's a real thing!!**) The last few years, before joining Switchfully, while working as scrum master (fancy word for project manager), I promoted the [agile values](https://agilemanifesto.org/) together with the software development teams I was collaboring with.

## I want more
Besides a strong interest in learning people to program, there are other (technical) topics ["I want more"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyO1dRCNnTY) off.

### I want more QR codes
They are nifty

### I want more security and privacy
It's essential

## What Else Is There? ‰ªñ„Å´„ÅØ‰Ωï„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã„ÅÆÔºü
So? ["What Else Is There?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4rZE_J1beA)

I'd like to harvest my own vegetables at [a farm in Leuven](https://www.boerencompagnie.be/) and starting in August I'll try to study some Japanese on Duolingo. (At this moment, I have absolutely NO idea what the strange characters in the title actually mean ...)

## So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
That's it for today! The next few months, Switchfully will be your Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy of programming and I am genuinely honoured to be part of your journey to become a passionate software developer.

Talk to you soon, in the Switchfully chat!
